# Project Proposal

## Project Title
Flashcards - For exams & For fun!

## What and Why?
### What?
We want to create a flashcards game with a baseline system to let students study for exams in various disciplines, and let foreigners or multilingual learners memorize words and phrases in foreign languages. In addition, the application would also allow users to DIY their own flashcards, such as Q&A and filling in the blanks and even inserting pictures.
### Why? 
Basically, it’s really hard for people to memorize words in a second language. Even native speakers can sometimes have a hard time memorizing obscure words like those appearing in the GRE exams. Flashcards would be a very interactive way to help retain and refresh people’s memory in the form of playing a small game. Also, linking words to pictures would be a good way for associative memory.

## For whom?
Students studying for exams, language learners…Anyone who needs to memorize vocabularies or terminologies!

## How?
Users will go to a website to access the flashcard. They can either search for existed dictionaries (e.g. GRE vocabulary dictionary, Merriam-Webster, Collins Dictionary, etc.) or DIY their own vocabulary library and add the dictionaries to their learning center. Then they can start to use the flashcards to memorize words, do quizzes, etc.

## Scope
We need 5-6 members to contribute to this application.
2 people work on establishing databases (including setting up basic dictionaries) in the back end.
2 people work in the front end to realize the flashcards interaction.
1-2 people work on the DIY part to allow users to create their own flashcards with input questions and output answers.
